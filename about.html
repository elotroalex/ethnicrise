We honor Lorgia García Peña’s extraordinary contributions to numerous fields with groundbreaking research by paying tribute to her work through a moderated online forum and subsequent Twitter Chat/Conversation/Convention. Garcia Peña is the author of <em>The Borders of Dominicanidad: Race, Nation, and Archives of Contradiction</em> (Duke UP, 2016), winner of the 2017 National Women’s Studies Association Gloria E. Anzaldúa Book Prize, the 2016 LASA Latino/a Studies Book Award, and the 2016 Isis Duarte Book Prize in Haiti and Dominican Studies. She has authored articles that have appeared in <em>Kalfou</em>, <em>The Black Scholar</em>, <em>Afro-Hispanic Review</em>, and <em>Caribbean Studies</em>. Her current book, <em>Translating Blackness: Migrations and Detours of Latinx Colonialities in Global Perspectives</em> (Duke UP, forthcoming), focuses on the black Latin American migrants’ engage in forms of racial translation as they move to and from their home countries, the U.S., and Europe.

Garcia Pena’s work already has shaped Afro-Latinx Studies and Afro-Latin American Studies, fields that are in formation, and will continue to do so. Her influential work also reverberates across established interdisciplinary fields of study: Black Studies, Latinx Studies, Caribbean Studies, and Ethnic Studies. In fact, Garcia Pena is at the forefront of a more robust set of conversations between and across these fields.
