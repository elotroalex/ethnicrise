## Roundtable

<h3>Coming Soon</h3>

Our Scholarly Online Roundtable will open with a series of correspondences between scholars, reflecting on Ethnic Studies, broadly, and its relationship to (Transnational and Hemisphericl) American Studies and other interdisciplinary fields of study (Black Studies, Latinx Studies, Caribbean Studies). Scholars will also be invited to discuss Dr. García Peña’s original contribution and her own position within Ethnic Studies and (Transnational and Hemispheric) American Studies.

These scholars will participate in paired and moderated email conversations, which will then be uploaded to this site. For a limited time comments will be open to respond to the perspectives presented on the various topics. These conversations will form a sort of foundation for Part 2, LorgiaFest...
